### 🌍 Chunking Collector — Open Source Java Library

**Tech Stack:** Java 8+ • Streams API • Maven Central • GitHub Actions • JavaDoc
**Links:** [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/dev.zachmaddox/chunking-collector/overview) • [JavaDoc](https://zachmaddox.dev/chunking-collector/latest/) • [GitHub](https://github.com/zmad5306/chunking-collector)

**Chunking Collector** is a lightweight, zero-dependency Java library that extends the **Stream API** to make data batching and segmentation both elegant and memory-efficient.
It provides collectors and utilities for **fixed-size chunks, sliding windows, and weighted batch collection** — ideal for stream processing, ETL pipelines, or any workload that needs to handle large datasets gracefully.

#### ✨ Highlights

- Implemented as a native **Stream Collector**, integrating seamlessly with Java’s functional APIs.
- **No dependencies**, Java 8+ compatible, and published to **Maven Central**.
- Versioned **JavaDoc** hosted on a custom domain at [zachmaddox.dev](https://zachmaddox.dev/chunking-collector).
- Automated CI/CD via **GitHub Actions**, publishing tagged versions to Maven Central and deploying versioned docs.
- Designed for **clarity, performance, and reliability** — tested across stream types (`List`, `Set`, primitives, custom collectors).

#### 🧩 Maven Dependency

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>dev.zachmaddox</groupId>
  <artifactId>chunking-collector</artifactId>
  <version>1.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```

#### 💬 Description

Built to solve a recurring pain point in stream processing — how to efficiently group elements into sublists without custom loop logic — Chunking Collector turns this into a **one-liner**:

```java
List<List<Integer>> batches = IntStream.range(0, 100)
    .boxed()
    .collect(Chunking.fixedSize(10));
```

The project represents Zach’s belief that **open source should be simple, elegant, and immediately useful**.
It’s not just a library — it’s a demonstration of thoughtful API design and modern CI automation.
