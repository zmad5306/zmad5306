### 🌍 Chunking Collector — Open Source Java Library

**Tech Stack:** Java 8+ • Streams API • Maven Central • GitHub Actions • JavaDoc
**Links:** [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/dev.zachmaddox/chunking-collector/overview) • [JavaDoc](https://zachmaddox.dev/chunking-collector/latest/) • [GitHub](https://github.com/zmad5306/chunking-collector)

**Chunking Collector** is a zero-dependency Java library that extends the Stream API for **batching, segmentation, and windowed collection** of data. It enables expressive, memory-safe chunking of streams without loops or side effects.

- Built as a native `Collector` implementation for seamless use with Java streams.
- 100% dependency-free and Java 8+ compatible.
- Versioned JavaDocs hosted at [zachmaddox.dev](https://zachmaddox.dev/chunking-collector).
- Automated **GitHub Actions** workflow publishes new versions to Maven Central and GitHub Pages.
- Demonstrates strong API design, CI automation, and open-source craftsmanship.

### 📱 Compose Reorderable Grid — Jetpack Compose UI Library

**Tech Stack:** Kotlin • Jetpack Compose • Android • Maven Central • GitHub  
**Links:** [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/dev.zachmaddox.compose/compose-reorderable-grid/overview) • [GitHub](https://github.com/zmad5306/compose-reorderable-grid)

**Compose Reorderable Grid** is a production-grade, long-press drag-and-drop grid for **Jetpack Compose**, extracted and refined from a real shipping Android application. It focuses on predictable behavior, gesture stability, and smooth auto-scrolling—addressing edge cases that commonly break naïve reorderable grid implementations.

- Long-press–based drag-and-drop interaction aligned with platform expectations.
- Smooth auto-scroll while dragging, even with large, scrollable grids.
- Stable gesture handling that survives recomposition without pointer restarts.
- Predictable drop targets using explicit, padding-aware hit testing.
- Minimal, focused API designed for clarity and safe adoption.
- Published to **Maven Central** and actively used in production.

The project reflects a pragmatic approach to UI engineering—prioritizing correctness, debuggability, and user trust over clever abstractions—and serves as both a reusable library and a reference implementation for complex touch interactions in Compose.

### 🏠 Homelab & Self-Hosting

Operates a self-hosted **Linux server** running containerized applications (Nextcloud, Pi-hole, WireGuard VPN) via Docker Compose — a sandbox for continuous learning, networking, and automation.

## PRINCIPLES OF AI-AUGMENTED ENGINEERING

1. **Humans Design, AI Builds** – Engineers define purpose; AI executes within boundaries.
2. **Guardrails Before Generation** – Context, safety, and clarity precede automation.
3. **Trust, But Verify** – AI drafts, engineers validate.
4. **Engineer the System, Not the Syntax** – Design for maintainability, not verbosity.
5. **Augment, Don’t Abdicate** – AI accelerates; judgment guides.

> _AI doesn’t replace expertise — it replaces tedium. In capable hands, it magnifies engineering excellence._
