## PRINCIPLES OF AI-AUGMENTED ENGINEERING

1. **Humans Design, AI Builds** – Engineers define purpose; AI executes within boundaries.
2. **Guardrails Before Generation** – Context, safety, and clarity precede automation.
3. **Trust, But Verify** – AI drafts, engineers validate.
4. **Engineer the System, Not the Syntax** – Design for maintainability, not verbosity.
5. **Augment, Don’t Abdicate** – AI accelerates; judgment guides.

> _AI doesn’t replace expertise — it replaces tedium. In capable hands, it magnifies engineering excellence._
