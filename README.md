# 🧭 Principles of AI-Augmented Engineering

### 1. **Humans Design, AI Builds**  
AI accelerates implementation, but it does not define architecture or intent.  
Engineers specify purpose, constraints, and success criteria — AI executes within those boundaries.

### 2. **Guardrails Before Generation**  
Quality code starts with clear context: inputs, outputs, environment, and safety limits.  
AI without constraints is automation without responsibility.

### 3. **Trust, but Verify**  
Every AI output is a draft — not truth.  
Engineers review, test, and validate all generated code before it reaches production.

### 4. **Context Is the Source of Truth**  
AI can produce patterns, but only engineers understand *why* those patterns matter.  
Human reasoning aligns automation with business goals, compliance, and reliability.

### 5. **Engineer the System, Not the Syntax**  
Typing code isn’t the job — designing maintainable, observable, secure systems is.  
AI frees engineers to think bigger and deliver smarter.

### 6. **Augment, Don’t Abdicate**  
Use AI as a capable junior developer: fast, tireless, and literal.  
Guide it, correct it, and teach it — but never surrender engineering judgment.

## ⚡ **AI in Capable Hands**

> *AI doesn’t replace expertise — it replaces tedium.*  
> In skilled hands, AI compresses a month of engineering into days.  
> In unskilled hands, it just produces garbage faster.  
>
> AI magnifies the operator — not the machine.  
> The outcome reflects the clarity, discipline, and judgment of the engineer guiding it.

*Written and practiced by engineers who believe human judgment, not automation, defines software excellence.*
